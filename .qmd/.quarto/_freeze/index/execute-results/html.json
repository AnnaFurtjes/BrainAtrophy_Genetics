For consistency, the analysis steps outlined below match the order of presentation in the manuscript but does not necessarily reflect the order in which analyses were executed.\n\nPre-registration: <https://osf.io/gydmw/>\n\n# Analysis steps\n\n**Data preparation**\n\n1.  UK Biobank\n\n    1.1.    [Phenotypic data](../_site/UKB_pheno.html)\n    \n    1.2.    Neuroimaging data \n    \n    1.3.    Genetic data\n\n2.  LBC1936\n\n    2.1.
