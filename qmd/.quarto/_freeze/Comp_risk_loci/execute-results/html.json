Compare locus boundaries\n  \n  2. Compare lead and significant SNPs\n  \n  3. Compare mapped genes\n  \n\n# Load packages\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(data.table)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'data.table' was built under R version 4.2.3\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readxl)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'readxl' was built under R version 4.2.3\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(stringr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# Read in data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndir = paste0(substr(out, 1, 76), \"Results/FUMA\")\n\n# loci\nresid_loci <- fread(paste0(dir, \"/resid_loci.txt\"))\nratio_loci <- fread(paste0(dir, \"/ratio_loci.txt\"))\ndiff_loci <- fread(paste0(dir, \"/diff_loci.txt\"))\n\n# genes\nresid_genes = fread(paste0(dir,\"/resid_mapped_genes.txt\"))\nratio_genes = fread(paste0(dir,\"/ratio_mapped_genes.txt\"))\ndiff_genes = fread(paste0(dir,\"/diff_mapped_genes.txt\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Compare locus boundaries\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# save results\nNames <- c(\"Resid_locus\", \"overlap_with_ratio\", \"overlap_with_diff\")\nsave <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = length(Names), nrow=length(unique(resid_loci$GenomicLocus))))\nnames(save) <- Names\nsave$Resid_locus <- resid_loci$GenomicLocus\nsave$overlap_with_ratio <- FALSE\nsave$overlap_with_diff <- FALSE\n\n# Comparison with ratio score\nfor(j in save$Resid_locus){\n  #
