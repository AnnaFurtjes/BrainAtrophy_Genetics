We had decided to include the 40 genetic PCs because they are provided by UKB and have routinely included been included in previous neuroimaging genetic GWAS using the UK Biobank data.\n\nHere, we are relying on a toolkit by [Prive et al. 2020](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/16/4449/5838185) to better understand the structure of genetic PCs in our 43k neuroimaging subsample. The results presented below were used to decide that we will repeat our GWAS analysis by controlling for 8 genetic PCs.\n\nCode was adopted from [here](https://privefl.github.io/bigsnpr/articles/bedpca.html) and ran very smoothly.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(bigsnpr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# load bed file\nbedfile <- \"ukb_neuroimaging_brainAtrophy_GWASinput.bed\"\nobj.bed <- bed(bedfile)\n\n# this data was previously cleaned and should not contain any related individuals, so this next step will include all pparticipants in the bed file\nind.norel <- rows_along(obj.bed)\n\n# then calculate PCA with specialised function\nobj.svd <- bed_autoSVD(obj.bed, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tind.row = ind.norel, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tk = 30,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tncores = 50,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmax.iter = 10)\n\n# original code uses nb_cores() to determine number of cores used, but this was too many for running on gallowglass1 -
