This was only added on request of the reviewers. There may be a more elegant way to test whether there is a significant difference between two heritability estimates, this is certainly the most straightforward one, assuming that the difference between the h2 estimates follow a normal distribution (which I think is questionable?).
The formula I use here includes a correlation term in the denominator (the correlation between the two heritability estimates taken from LDSC calculations), which will increase the z value (i.e., be more likely significant) because we are dividing the difference between two values by a smaller number 


```{r, message=F, warning=F}
# h2 residual score
h2_1 <- 0.41
# h2 ratio score
h2_2 <- 0.42
se_1 <- 0.01
se_2 <- 0.01

# correlation between h2 taken from LDSC correlations
corr = 0.96

# calculate z score
z = (h2_1 - h2_2)/sqrt(se_1^2 + se_2^2 - (2 * corr * se_1 * se_2))
#z

# get p-value for z score one tailed test
p = pnorm(q = z,
          mean = 0, # mean of the normal distribution
          sd = 1,
          lower.tail = T) # standard deviation of the normal distribution

# not multiplying by 2 here because I have a specific expectation that one estimate is larger here and I am only asking whether it is or it isnt 

if (p < 0.05) {
  res_ratio = paste0("Reject the null hypothesis:\nh2 for the residual score is significantly smaller than h2 for the ratio score:\nz = ", round(z, digits=2), "; p = ", signif(p, digits=2),".")
} else {
  res_ratio = paste0("Fail to reject the null hypothesis:\nh2 for the residual score is not significantly smaller than h2 for the ratio score:\nz = ", round(z, digits=2), "; p = ", signif(p, digits=2),".")
}

Comparison residual & ratio score:

`r res_ratio`


Comparison residual & difference score:

`r res_diff`

Reference to future self:

I got confused for a minute about whether the formula contained se or se^2 values, because I found conflicting sources online. One sample z test uses se in the denominator, and the two sample z test has to consider the se of the difference between two measures which is why we exponentiate: 

SE of the difference between the two measures is sqrt(se^2 + se^2)
