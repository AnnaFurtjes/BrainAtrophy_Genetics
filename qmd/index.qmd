Here I display the analysis code to accompany our lifetime brain atrophy (LBA) genetics project. For consistency, the analysis steps outlined below match the order of presentation in the manuscript but does not necessarily reflect the order in which analyses were executed.

# Analysis steps

## Data preparation

1.  UK Biobank

    1.1.    [Phenotypic data](UKB_pheno.html)
    
    1.2.    [Neuroimaging data](UKB_neuro.html)
    
    1.3.    [Genetic data](UKB_geneticQC.html)

2.  LBC1936

    2.1. [Phenotypic data](LBC_pheno.html)
    
    2.2. [Neuroimaging data](LBC_neuro.html)

3.  [Human Connectome Project (HCP)](HCP.html)

4.  [Generation Scotland Subsample (STRADL)](STRADL.html)

5.  [MRi-Share](MRiShare.html)

## Description and characterisation of the LBA phenotype
